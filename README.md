## What It Is
This is a game that I have been on and off developing for since 2020. It started out as a game jam that you can play [here](https://evasiveace.itch.io/ninja-ninja-gamejam), and was my first complete project as a game developer. Since then, I have learned a lot 
and I wanted to turn this project into something meaningful.

The gameplay loop revolves around the player, the Ninja, making his way through multiple areas until you get to the final boss. Each specific area has around ~10 floors, with shops and random item rooms sprawled out.
Each run is different, and each win unlocks more items for the player to find and experience.

The main form of combat is rolling dice to 'attack', meaning there is a good chance that even with good items, you can get unlucky and lose. 

### Remember, losing is fun!

## Where to play
### Coming soon!
Currently, this is coming soon, but a beta version of the game will be out to play in the browser on itch.io.
